    "description": "Introduced in 1981 by Altos Computer Systems, the ACS8000-12A is a multi-user microcomputer built around a 4 MHz Zilog Z80A processor. Housed in a single desktop chassis, it pairs one internal 8-inch single-sided/double-density floppy drive with a 20 MB internal Winchester hard-disk, providing mass storage previously found only on far costlier minicomputers. The main board ships with 64 KB of RAM, expandable to 208 KB, and six serial ports plus two parallel ports allow up to four users to connect ASCII terminals and share compute resources concurrently. Each logged-in user is allocated a protected 48 KB memory slice under the MP/M or OASIS multi-user operating systems, while CP/M remains available for single-user operation. The system boots from floppy, then loads the OS and utilities from the hard disk, giving small offices and university labs an economical path to shared computing without the expense of a dedicated minicomputer.",

For $395 users received a complete set of parts—metal chassis, power supply, passive motherboard with 100-pin Altair-bus slots, and a front panel laden with switches and LEDs. Assembly required days of careful soldering; the base unit shipped with only 256 bytes of RAM, so programs were entered in machine code via toggle switches and results read from blinking LEDs. The Intel 8080 CPU, secured by MITS in volume for about $75, sat on a plug-in card; memory, I/O and other functions resided on additional cards. This modular, open design fostered a cottage industry of third-party boards—memory, serial interfaces, video, floppy controllers—and quickly turned the Altair-bus into the de-facto S-100 standard. Although initially impractical for everyday use, the platform’s expandability and low entry price ignited the microcomputer revolution, attracting hobbyists, clubs and eventually software entrepreneurs. Within months optional BASIC from the newly-formed Micro-Soft turned the Altair into a programmable system, spawning user groups, magazines like BYTE and an ecosystem of compatible machines. Production peaked at thousands of units per month before MITS was sold to Pertec in 1976, but by then the Altair had already defined what a personal computer could be.",

    "description": "The Amiga 3000, launched in June 1990, is Commodore’s third-generation 32-bit workstation, completely redesigned for high-end graphics and multitasking. Powered by a 16/25 MHz Motorola 68030 CPU and 68882 FPU, it delivers up to 18× integer and 200× floating-point speed gains over earlier Amigas. The Enhanced Chip Set (ECS) enables new high-resolution graphics modes, while a built-in scan-doubler/flicker-fixer converts the native 15 kHz signal to 31 kHz VGA for flicker-free display on PC monitors. A high-speed DMA SCSI controller supports up to seven internal or external devices, and the machine ships with a 40–100 MB hard drive. Workbench 2.04 introduces a polished GUI, improved programmer hooks, and optional Unix System V. Four Zorro II/III, one video, and two ISA slots provide flexible expansion; cards mount horizontally to save space. With its blend of advanced graphics, professional OS, and modular design, the A3000 positions itself as a powerful multimedia workstation.",

Video output was monochrome at 280×192 pixels or 40×24 characters, generated through a composite video port. A cassette interface provided external storage, while a single vertical expansion slot allowed limited hardware additions. The system firmware resided in ROM (HEX monitor), and Apple BASIC could be loaded from cassette. Keyboards and power supplies were left to the buyer, keeping costs down.

Its eight internal 50-pin expansion slots—unusual for a home computer—let owners add memory, disk controllers, parallel/serial interfaces, video enhancements, co-processor cards and more simply by plugging in off-the-shelf cards accessible under the lift-off lid. Storage began with an ordinary audio cassette; Apple introduced a 143 KB external floppy drive in 1978. Targeted at hobbyists, educators and small businesses, the machine’s flexibility and relatively generous 48 KB maximum RAM attracted developers, most notably the creators of VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet application, which debuted exclusively on the Apple II and quickly became a \"killer app,\" driving corporate sales. Over time a large ecosystem of first- and third-party hardware and software turned the Apple II into a versatile workhorse that remained in production, through successive models, until 1993.",

    "description": "Announced in May 1980 and shipped in limited quantities that fall, the Apple III was Apple’s first computer designed specifically for business users. Encased in a single, heavy aluminum chassis, it ran a 2 MHz Synertek 6502A CPU, shipped with 128 KB RAM (expandable to 512 KB), and was the first Apple machine to integrate a 143 KB 5.25-inch floppy drive. It offered 16-color composite video, four internal expansion slots compatible with Apple II cards, and built-in Apple II Plus emulation. The system debuted Apple’s SOS (Sophisticated Operating System) and included direct support for Apple’s Silentype thermal printer. Despite technical advances, the III suffered from severe thermal problems—exacerbated by the fan-less, sealed design demanded by Steve Jobs—and widespread hardware failures, leading Apple to replace 14,000 early units. Revised models with 256 KB RAM and, later, the Apple III Plus with working real-time clock and DB-25 ports failed to overcome the product’s poor reputation; only about 65,000 units were sold before the line was discontinued in April 1984.",

    "summary": "The Apple III, introduced in 1980, was Apple’s business-focused successor to the Apple II, featuring integrated floppy storage, a sealed aluminum chassis, and the new SOS operating system, but chronic overheating and reliability issues limited sales to about 65,000 units before discontinuation in 1984.",

Its sophisticated Lisa OS and office suite demanded large memory and disk resources, straining the hardware and resulting in sluggish performance. Although pioneering in usability, the high price and limited third-party software depressed sales; only about 6,500 units sold before Apple offered free upgrades to the Lisa 2/5, which replaced the unreliable Twiggy drives with a single 400 KB 3½-inch Sony floppy. Later variants included the Lisa 2/10 with internal 10 MB Widget drive and, after a motherboard redesign, the Macintosh XL that booted Macintosh OS.

Cooling was passive, eliminating fan noise. Inside sat a 4.77 MHz Intel 8086 CPU, 256 KB RAM (expandable to 768 KB), and a single Sony 3.5-inch 720 KB floppy drive, with an optional 10 MB hard disk. Graphics peaked at 640×256 pixels with 4–16 colours. The system shipped with MS-DOS 2.11 and ACT’s icon-driven Activity GUI, plus bundled productivity tools: SuperCalc, SuperWriter, ACT Diary, ACT Sketch and SuperPlanner. The keyboard housed a real-time clock; pressing its TIME/DATE key during boot transferred settings to the machine.

    "description": "The Atari 1200XL, released in February 1983, was a restyled successor to the Atari 400/800 series, housed in a slim aluminum-and-smoked-plastic case with matching peripherals. Internally it retained the same 1.79 MHz 6502C CPU and 64 KB RAM, but added new keyboard shortcuts (disable keys, blank screen for ~25 % speed gain), international character set toggle, TV-speaker key-click audio, side-mounted cartridge slot, and built-in diagnostics. Graphics modes 12-15 were exposed in BASIC and the keyboard was praised for its soft feel. Cost-cutting combined the previous multi-board design into one large motherboard, yet expansion was reduced: no parallel/RS-232 ports, no system bus, and the SIO port lacked the 12 V line found on earlier models. BASIC was still cartridge-only. Despite the refined appearance, performance was unchanged and the $899 launch price was high; price cuts to $695 and then $599 failed to spur sales. Within eight months the 1200XL was discontinued, replaced by the cheaper 600XL and 800XL models that addressed many of its limitations.",

Built around an 8 MHz Motorola 68000 CPU and 512 KB of RAM, it shipped with an external 360 KB single-sided 3.5-inch floppy drive, a mouse, and a choice of monochrome or color monitors. Graphics modes spanned 320×200 with 16 colors, 640×200 with 4 colors, and a high-resolution 640×400 monochrome panel. Connectivity included dual MIDI ports, RGB video, plus serial, parallel, joystick, and cartridge interfaces. The operating system—TOS (Tramiel Operating System)—and Digital Research’s GEM GUI had to be loaded from disk on early units because ROM was not yet ready, a shortcut shared with its contemporary rival, the Commodore Amiga. GEM provided a Macintosh-like desktop, though reviewers noted it was less refined. Built-in VT52 emulation let the machine act as a serial terminal, appealing to hobbyists and musicians who appreciated the integral MIDI hardware. The 520ST established Atari’s ST line, setting the stage for later models with internal drives and expanded memory.",

Powered by an 8 MHz Motorola 68000 and TOS 1.4 stored in ROM, it offers near-complete software compatibility with desktop STs while adding built-in MIDI, parallel, serial, and monitor ports. Early plans for C-cell battery operation proved futile—four megabytes of RAM and a hard disk drained cells in roughly 15 minutes—so the machine ran from an external power brick. Factory options included 20 MB hard disks and up to 4 MB of RAM via proprietary cards. Although its weight and price limited mass-market appeal, the Stacy became a cult machine among musicians, desktop publishers, and developers who needed a transportable ST environment.",

Additional features include an 90,000-word spell checker, inline spreadsheet calculations, a 300/1200 baud text-only modem, and one-button save/restore of the entire workspace to disk.

A Z80-A CPU running at 3.58 MHz drove the machine, which output 16-colour graphics and 36×24 text to TV or composite monitors. AdamNet, a proprietary 62.5 kbps serial bus, linked the console, printer and future peripherals; standard RS-232 or parallel ports were absent. ROM held only a word processor; SmartBASIC and other software loaded from Coleco’s proprietary \"Digital Data Packs.\" The cartridge slot accepted all ColecoVision titles, blurring the line between game console and computer. Early printer failures forced a last-minute recall that cost Coleco the 1983 holiday season, and publicised reliability woes dogged the machine until production ended in January 1985 after barely fifteen months on the market.",

A 64 KB RAM and three-voice SID audio subsystem are carried over unchanged, giving it almost complete software compatibility with cartridges and disks designed for the desktop C-64; only the cassette port is omitted. The built-in composite/S-video outputs allow connection to an external monitor, while ports for two joysticks, serial, cartridge, and a user port provide full expansion. Powered exclusively from 110 VAC mains, the SX-64 targets professionals and demonstrators who need a self-contained, color-capable system on the move. Despite its engineering feat, the high price—roughly double that of a standard C-64—and the small screen limited market appeal.",

Compaq’s engineers achieved legal compatibility by using “black-box” testing—feeding inputs to IBM’s BIOS and documenting outputs—then writing new code that replicated the behavior, a process that cost $1 million and took a year. Priced at $3,590 for the dual-floppy model, the computer sold 53,000 units in its first year and helped Compaq reach $111 million in revenue, setting American business records and proving that a start-up could challenge IBM on compatibility and portability.",

Housed in a suitcase-sized case with a built-in 9-inch monochrome monitor and a full-size keyboard, the 26-pound unit was designed for transportability rather than true mobility, lacking internal batteries and requiring mains power. Four configurations were offered, ranging from dual-floppy models with 256 KB RAM to versions with 640 KB RAM and 10 or 20 MB hard drives. The system shipped with MS-DOS 3.2 and provided standard PC expansion via parallel, serial, and CGA ports. Users toggle speed with Ctrl-Alt-\\; a single beep on boot indicates 6 MHz, two beeps 8 MHz. The Portable II consolidated the functionality of a desktop into a single, rugged enclosure, making it popular among professionals needing a transportable computer.",

Housed in a heavy industrial enclosure, it shipped with 4 KB RAM (expandable to 32 KB), an Intel 8080 CPU, and up to two RS-232 ports. Storage relied on external 8-track continuous-loop \"floppy-tape\" drives running at 4800 baud; later upgrades supported 8-inch floppy disks via WD1771-based controllers. The machine boots into CRT terminal mode; pressing ESC W enters Compucolor BASIC, ESC P activates a machine-level monitor, and with disk hardware ESC D invokes a DOS-like File Control System. The optical keyboard uses light beams and coded masks, eliminating mechanical switches. Although expensive and bulky, the Compucolor 8001 is remembered as one of the first desktop computers to offer built-in color graphics.",

    "description": "Introduced in September 1984, the Data General One (DG-1) was the first battery-powered, IBM-compatible portable computer to ship with a full-size 11-inch LCD. Housed in a clamshell case weighing 9 pounds, it used an Intel 80C88 processor running at 4 MHz and came with 128 KB of RAM, expandable to 512 KB. Storage consisted of one or two internal 720 KB 3.5-inch floppy drives—the first portable to adopt Sony’s newly introduced disks. The monochrome LCD displayed 80×25 text or 640×256 graphics, though contrast was poor and the screen only locked fully open or closed. An internal rechargeable battery provided up to eight hours of runtime, while an external 5.8 VDC supply recharged the pack. Standard ports included serial, parallel, telephone and a proprietary system bus; an optional 300-baud internal modem and terminal-emulation software let the machine act as a terminal for Data General’s CEO office-automation suite. Base price was $2,895 with one drive and 128 KB RAM; adding a second drive, extra RAM, external 5.25-inch drive, thermal printer or modem could push cost well above $4,000. Over the next four years Data General released improved Models 2 and 2T with better displays, higher speeds and optional hard disks, but heavy batteries and bulky construction quickly left the series behind as lighter portables emerged.",

    "description": "The Datapoint 2200, released in November 1970 by Computer Terminal Corporation (CTC), was originally marketed as a programmable terminal intended to replace the IBM 029 card punch machine. It featured a wide 80x12-character CRT display mimicking the dimensions of an IBM punched card and a built-in dual cassette drive system running CTOS (Cassette Tape Operating System). Internally it used hundreds of discrete TTL chips—no single-chip microprocessor existed at the time—although CTC later commissioned Intel and Texas Instruments to condense the logic; Intel’s resulting 1201 prototype evolved into the commercial 8008 microprocessor. Two hardware versions were produced: Version I employed slow serial recirculating memory (Intel 1405 shift registers), while Version II introduced parallel RAM, cutting memory access from 520 µs to 4.8 µs and instruction times by roughly 75%. Packaged in a typewriter-sized desktop case with a full keyboard, the 2200 weighed 25 kg and cost $7,800–$11,700 in 1972. Despite its high price, it sold 50–200 units per month and by mid-1973 about 2,500 had shipped worldwide. CTC rebranded itself as Datapoint in 1972, and the 2200 platform later gained printers, disk drives, and the ARCnet local-area network, becoming the company’s core business until the founders departed in 1974.",
    "hallmark": "First commercial desktop programmable terminal built entirely from discrete logic, whose architecture directly inspired Intel’s 8008 microprocessor.",
    "summary": "Announced in June 1970 and shipped that November, the Datapoint 2200 was a discrete-logic desktop unit intended as a smart card-punch replacement but evolved into an early programmable terminal and later a complete multi-user computer system.",

    "description": "Released in 1978, the Exidy Sorcerer is an early home computer built around a 2 MHz Zilog Z-80 processor and offered with 8, 16 or 32 KB of RAM. Instead of a built-in language it ships with a 2 KB ROM monitor that lets users examine or patch memory and control dual cassette interfaces; all high-level software is loaded from cassette or distinctive black 8-track-style ROM cartridges called ROM-Pacs that plug into the right side. Composite video output delivers 512×240 pixel black-and-white graphics or 64×30 text on any monitor. An edge connector exposes address, data and control lines, and an optional S-100 expansion chassis accepts industry-standard cards. Although sold by Exidy in the United States, the machine found greater success in Europe through distributor CompuData, which later continued production as Tulip Computers. Two main motherboard revisions exist: the launch DP1000-1 with flawed serial circuitry and the more common DP1000-2 (Sorcerer II) that raises maximum RAM to 48 KB.",

Video output is composite, offering 560×192 pixel graphics plus 40- or 80-column text modes; an optional RGB interface card provides a sharper signal for 80-column displays. Standard features include a built-in 143 KB 5.25-inch floppy drive, two joystick ports, a parallel printer port, and two internal expansion slots for memory, serial, or video cards. The machine boots Franklin DOS 2, a legal re-implementation of Apple’s ProDOS that maintains broad software compatibility. Physically, the ACE 2100 separates the full-stroke keyboard from the system unit—an unusual feature for Apple II-class machines of the era—and uses an external universal power supply, reducing internal heat. Expansion options documented by collectors include a second floppy drive, RGB cards, and double-high-resolution add-ons. The system was sold primarily through educational and small-business channels at a list price of US $999, undercutting Apple’s IIe while offering comparable performance and greater out-of-the-box memory.",

Storage relied on two removable flash memory card slots accepting 256K or 512K cards; no rotating media was present in the original model. Interaction occurred primarily through the attached stylus and an on-screen keyboard handwriting input was enabled by Jeff Hawkins’ patented PalmPrint recognition software. An RS-232 serial port allowed file transfer via LapLink or an optional internal modem and an external keyboard could be plugged in. Weighing 4.5 pounds the magnesium-cased device targeted mobile professionals and sold about 10 000 units in 1990.",

Housed in a rugged, flat-black die-cast magnesium alloy case, it featured a bright 6-inch electroluminescent display capable of 80×24 text and 320×240 graphics. Powered by an 8 MHz Intel 8086 CPU and 256 KB of DRAM, it used 384 KB of non-volatile bubble memory for internal storage instead of a floppy drive. The system ran the proprietary GRiD-OS, a menu-driven suite including applications for text editing, spreadsheets, database, plotting, and BASIC programming. Lacking a battery, it required AC power and generated significant heat, necessitating operation with its rear leg extended. Despite its US$8150 price, it found use among business executives, U.S. military field units, and NASA Space Shuttle missions throughout the 1980s. External 5.25-inch floppy or 10 MB hard disk drives could be added, and a 300/1200 baud modem enabled dial-up access to the GRiD Central online service. With all components soldered and no upgrade sockets, the 1101 was a sealed, self-contained portable workstation that set the template for modern laptops.",

A built-in 3.5-inch floppy drive and 300-baud modem were rare conveniences for the era. Instead of a trackball, Gavilan placed a solid-state touch-pad above the keyboard, letting users move an on-screen cursor with a finger—an early precursor to modern touchpads. The machine booted either Gavilan’s own windowing OS or MS-DOS 2.11, presenting menus, windows, and prompts navigated through the pad. Priced at US $3,995, the system won praise for portability and innovation, but production problems, slow sales, and fierce competition forced the company into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October 1984; Gavilan closed for good in 1985.",

A manual magnetic-card reader on the right edge accepted 1.4 K cards for program and data exchange, while three front-mounted expansion bays accepted tiny RAM or ROM cartridges for instant capability boosts. An HP-IL serial interface on the rear allowed connection to printers, tape drives, and other peripherals. The machine shipped with a real-time clock and appointment alarm, and its modular architecture encouraged third-party ROMs for everything from statistics to text editing.

Although HP marketing called it a \"calculator\" to avoid corporate purchasing resistance, the unit is a complete self-contained computer: QWERTY alphanumeric keyboard, 32-character LED display, BASIC interpreter in ROM, and a built-in cassette drive for program and data storage. A 4 KB RAM base model cost $5,975; an 8 KB upgrade was available. The processor, built from 7400-series TTL on multiple gold-plated boards, runs at 8 MHz and leaves all RAM free for user programs because the OS and language reside in ROM. Up to eight optional 2 KB ROM modules extend functionality, and the rear panel offers four I/O slots for printers, plotters or other peripherals. The matching HP-9866A thermal line printer, capable of 240 lines per minute, was a popular add-on. Weighing 45 lb, the 9830A was big but entirely self-contained, making it one of the first truly usable desktop computers for laboratories, businesses and education.",

A compulsory 4 KB memory board pushed the effective entry price higher, and serial or floppy storage required extra cards. The computer used Heath’s proprietary 50-pin Benton Harbor expansion bus with ten slots, eschewing the more common S-100 standard. An onboard keypad and nine-digit LED display allowed simple operation, while HDOS (Heath Disk Operating System) managed disks once the optional H-17 dual-floppy drive arrived in 1978.

    "description": "Released in February 1978, the IBM 5110 is a compact desktop computer aimed at business users. It uses IBM’s proprietary 1.9 MHz processor and shipped with 16 KB RAM, expandable to 64 KB. A built-in 5-inch monochrome monitor displays 64 columns by 16 rows of text. While an optional 200 KB internal tape drive is available, the system’s key advance is support for the external IBM 5114 dual 8-inch floppy drive, offering faster access and 1.2 MB capacity. The machine runs either APL or BASIC interpreters stored in ROM and communicates through a single peripheral I/O port that can handle additional floppies or the IBM 5103 dot-matrix printer. Three configurations exist: model 1 accepts internal and external tape; model 2 omits internal tape and relies on external floppies; model 3 integrates two floppy drives in a desktop cabinet. All versions share the same electronics and software, positioning the 5110 as IBM’s first self-contained system to combine a CRT, keyboard, and high-capacity removable storage in a package small enough for an office desk.",

The 5110 Model 3 itself contained the same eight-card processor cage as the earlier IBM 5110, but was repackaged in a new, more integrated chassis. A 9-inch CRT displayed 64×16 characters, switchable between normal and inverse video via an internal toggle. The system shipped with either APL or BASIC interpreters in ROM, targeting business and scientific users who needed immediate programmability without third-party software. Expansion was limited: a single I/O channel could accept one 5114 cabinet holding up to two 1.2 MB drives, and the 5103 printer connected through the same interface. Front-panel controls allowed operators to inspect processor registers, reset the system, or adjust monitor brightness. Despite its bulk, the 5120 offered an all-in-one solution for small offices already standardized on IBM’s data-processing workflow.",

Instead of standard ports, IBM provided a rear expansion bus for optional snap-in modules: a thermal/ribbon printer, serial/parallel adapter, or CRT display adapter that let users switch to an external monitor. Fully equipped, the system stretched an extra seven inches and weighed 20 pounds. Early LCDs suffered poor contrast, later replaced by improved and backlit panels.

    "description": "Released in September 1981, the IBM 5150 Personal Computer established the architectural template for the dominant PC platform. Built around Intel’s 8-bit 8088 running at 4.77 MHz, the base unit shipped with as little as 16 KB RAM and relied on an audio cassette for storage; one or two 160 KB 5.25-inch floppy drives were optional. A keyboard port, cassette interface and five internal ISA expansion slots provided the only connectivity—video, serial, parallel and memory cards occupied the slots in typical configurations. PC-DOS 1.0, Microsoft’s licensed MS-DOS, supplied the operating environment. Housed in a heavy sheet-metal chassis with the same buckling-spring keyboard used on IBM’s earlier Datamaster, the machine projected a professional image that appealed to businesses. Off-the-shelf hardware and a proprietary, copyrighted BIOS let IBM bring the system to market quickly while attempting to limit direct copying. Memory could be expanded from the motherboard’s 64 KB (later 256 KB with higher-density chips) to 640 KB via cards, and the open ISA bus encouraged third-party peripherals. Despite modest technical specifications compared with contemporary 16-bit machines, the 5150’s IBM badge, expandability and rapidly growing software library made it the de-facto business standard and the progenitor of the global PC clone ecosystem.",

Sharing an 8088 CPU and PC-DOS 2.10 with the IBM PC, it promised software compatibility but cut costs by omitting DMA and using proprietary sidecar expansion. The 64 KB base unit sold for US $669; a 128 KB model with internal 360 KB 5.25″ floppy cost $1,269. Video output was composite or RGB, supporting 80×25 text and 640×200 graphics in 16 colours. Memory topped out at 512 KB, and storage was handled by the single built-in floppy drive. Unique features included two front cartridge slots, two joystick ports, and a wireless chiclet keyboard whose tall hard-plastic keys and infrared link were widely criticised. Non-standard rear ports and the lack of DMA led to problems such as disabled keys during disk access and dropped serial data. About 270,000 units were made before the line was cancelled in March 1985.",
    "summary": "The IBM PCjr (1983) was IBM’s home-oriented, cartridge-capable 8088 computer that retained partial PC compatibility but suffered from cost-saving hardware limits, non-standard expansion, and a poorly received chiclet keyboard.",

    "description": "The Interact Model One, released in late 1978 by Interact Electronics, began as a 4 KB game console concept but evolved into a full home computer after two years and $1 million of development. Driven by a 2 MHz Intel 8080A CPU, it shipped with 8 KB or 16 KB RAM and stored all software on an integral cassette deck. To cut costs it lacked a character generator; the CPU drew large 17×12-character screens bit by bit. Edu-BASIC, included on cassette, supported only integer math, though an optional Microsoft Level II BASIC added floating-point and more commands. No peripheral ports beyond twin joystick connectors were provided. Four configurations were announced at the 1979 CES, but only the entry “Benchmark” and a “Standard” bundle reached market. Sales were weak, production ended in December 1979, and remaining stock was liquidated through Micro Video and others into the mid-1980s.",

    "description": "The Jupiter ACE is a compact British home computer released in April 1983 by Jupiter Cantab, a Cambridge-based start-up founded by two former Sinclair engineers. Housed in a white injection-moulded case with a rubber keyboard, the machine centres on a Z80 processor running at 3.25 MHz and shipped with just 3 KB of RAM. Video output is a 32-column by 24-row monochrome text display fed to a television via UHF channel 36, while programs and data are loaded and saved through a standard cassette interface. An edge connector at the rear provides both user I/O and RAM expansion. What distinguishes the ACE from every other contemporary micro is its built-in FORTH language kernel stored in ROM. This threaded interpretive language offers immediate interactivity: users can perform calculations or define new routines almost instantly, combining the succinctness of a high-level language with near-assembly execution speed. The machine was briefly marketed in the United States as the Jupiter ACE 4000, but internally the hardware remained unchanged. Despite technical ingenuity, sales were modest; the company entered liquidation only seven months after launch, leaving the ACE as a rare footnote in 1980s home computing.",

A 40×8-character reflective LCD (240×64 dots) provides a large, readable display, while a full-travel keyboard offers comfortable text entry. Standard RAM is 16 KB, expandable to 32 KB, held in battery-backed CMOS so data survives power loss. Mass storage relies on an audio-cassette interface; an optional external 5¼-inch floppy drive can be added via RS-232. The machine ships with built-in applications—Microsoft BASIC (reportedly the last major code contribution from Bill Gates), a text editor and a telecom program—selected from a simple menu system. Weighing 1.7 kg and only about the size of a sheet of paper, the KC-85 set the template for subsequent licensed variants such as the TRS-80 Model 100, NEC PC-8201A and Olivetti M-10, collectively establishing the clamshell laptop concept.",

Unlike the 1.77 MHz Model I, the LNW80 ran its Z80A CPU at 4 MHz but could down-clock for compatibility. It shipped with 48 KB RAM, Microsoft BASIC in ROM, and added features the Model I lacked: a real-time clock, parallel and serial ports, cassette I/O at 500/1000 baud, and a built-in floppy interface supporting 5¼-inch or 8-inch drives. Graphics were enhanced to 480×192 resolution with optional color, although few TRS-80 programs exploited it. Initially sold as a $90 bare board, the fully assembled computer later retailed for $1 495; a kit version cost about $900. Despite its technical advantages, limited software support for the new capabilities and the company’s 1984 bankruptcy kept the machine uncommon.",

Using a resistive 5×8-inch LCD and a tethered stylus, it captures handwriting at about five characters per second after a short user-training phase. The unit is built around an NEC V20 CPU running at 7.16 MHz, includes 640 KB of RAM, and ships with MS-DOS 3.30. Mass storage consists of an internal 720 KB 3.5-inch floppy drive and a removable 512 KB battery-backed RAM card that appears as drive C:. Standard PC-compatible serial, printer, keyboard, and external floppy ports allow desktop-style use, while an optional internal modem enables remote data transfer. The rechargeable battery powers the system for roughly five hours. Target markets included healthcare, insurance, and field sales, where paper-form entry could be digitized on the spot. Despite its technical novelty, fewer than 2,000 units were sold, and the product was later licensed to TRW as the TRW Write-Top.",

The machine’s defining characteristic was its graphical user interface, accessed via a desktop of icons and windows manipulated with the bundled mouse—an approachable alternative to the text-only command lines of contemporary PCs. With no internal expansion slots and a sealed case, the base model was soon eclipsed by the 512 KB “Fat Mac,” but the Macintosh’s GUI, paired with bundled applications MacWrite and MacPaint, popularized desktop publishing and set the interaction paradigm for virtually all subsequent personal computers.",

It uses a 16 MHz Motorola 68HC000 processor, ships with 1 MB RAM that can be expanded to 9 MB, and includes a 10-inch active-matrix black-and-white LCD running at 640×400 pixels. An internal Conner 40 MB SCSI hard drive and 1.4 MB 3.5-inch floppy drive handle storage, while a built-in trackball and ADB, serial, SCSI, and video ports provide user interaction and expansion. Power comes from a sealed 6.5 V lead-acid gel battery that delivers 6–12 hours of runtime but adds about 2 lb to the already hefty 16 lb chassis. The back-lit revision (model M5126, 1991) improves screen visibility at the cost of halving battery life. A dedicated Processor Direct Slot allows high-speed expansion cards, and the system shipped with Mac OS 6.0.4. Despite its advanced active-matrix display and performance competitive with desktop Macs of the era, the machine’s size, weight, and high price limited its market appeal and production ended in early 1991.",

    "description": "Apple's Macintosh PowerBook, introduced in October 1991 and discontinued a year later, was the company's first successful notebook line. Developed in partnership with Sony, the PowerBook 100, 140, and 170 offered a compact, lightweight design compared with the earlier Macintosh Portable. The series featured a Motorola 68HC000 processor at 16 MHz, 2–8 MB of RAM, a 640 × 400 monochrome LCD, and optional 20 MB or 40 MB SCSI hard drives alongside a 1.4 MB floppy. Connectivity included ADB, one or two serial ports, and a hard‑drive port. Running Mac OS 7.01‑7.6.1, the PowerBooks were priced between US$2,299 and US$4,599. Their most notable innovation was the ergonomic layout that placed the keyboard toward the rear with a palm‑rest and integrated trackball at the front, a design that set the standard for future laptops. Over 100,000 units sold in the first three months, the PowerBook established Apple as a leader in portable computing.",

Powered by an AMD K5 processor running at 75 MHz, the system shipped with 16 MB of RAM (expandable to 80 MB), 512 KB of EDO video memory, and a 1 GB hard drive, alongside standard multimedia features such as a 4× CD-ROM and a 3.5-inch floppy drive. Connectivity options included a 33.6 Kbps FAX/modem, serial, parallel, game-controller, and VGA ports, while Windows 95 came pre-installed. Initially sold exclusively through CompUSA for US$999.95, the 7245 targeted budget-conscious home and small-office buyers seeking a space-saving, easy-to-set-up Windows PC.

Built-in ports include serial, parallel, and a 300-baud modem, while three hardware-level hotkeys provide instant access to a clock/calendar, a simple four-function calculator, and a terminal program for the internal modem. Although not fully IBM-compatible, Morrow claimed compatibility with most major productivity packages. Early units suffered from poor screen contrast, prompting a February 1985 revision that added an electroluminescent backlight. The Pivot was the first and last MS-DOS machine from George Morrow’s company, licensed to Osborne as the Osborne Encore and to Zenith (Z-171), and was superseded by the improved Pivot II in 1985.",

The system shipped with one or two internal 8-inch floppy drives and could boot CP/M-86 or MS-DOS 2.11 from diskette. Expansion was via five proprietary internal slots, and external connectivity included serial and parallel ports. The APC’s graphics subsystem supported zoom, pan, split-screen scrolling and even light-pen input, capabilities that were rare among early PCs and positioned the machine for CAD and technical illustration work. Housed in a heavy desktop chassis, the computer was sold in monochrome and color configurations, with the latter commanding a premium price.",

Instead of floppy or hard disks, it relied exclusively on a 256 MB Canon magneto-optical cartridge that held the complete NeXTSTEP operating system, applications and user data, allowing a user to boot any NeXT system with their personal cartridge. A 17-inch monochrome monitor delivered 1120×832 resolution, while built-in Thin-net Ethernet, SCSI and CD-quality stereo sound provided connectivity and multimedia. NeXTSTEP, built atop the Mach UNIX kernel, introduced object-oriented developer tools and Display PostScript for true WYSIWYG graphics. Priced at $6,500, the machine shipped with NeXTSTEP v0.9 and was sold through Businessland, but high cost and delayed availability limited sales to a few hundred units in 1989.",

A five-slot 86-line expansion bus accepted add-ons such as 4 KB or 16 KB static RAM boards, a color video card, and a \"giant board\" that added cassette, serial, parallel I/O and monitor ROM. The unit shipped with concise documentation enabling beginners to learn 1802 machine language, after which they could run Tiny BASIC or custom programs. The open bus architecture let hobbyists assemble a capable system for far less than contemporary pre-assembled microcomputers.",

An ARM 610 RISC processor running at 20 MHz powered Newton OS 1.05, which shipped with Notes, Names, Dates, Calculator, Currency Converter and Time-Zones Maps. Notes accepted free-form handwriting and sketches, converting them to editable text via the much-publicised but frequently criticised handwriting-recognition engine; Names stored contacts, Dates managed calendars. 640 KB of battery-backed RAM held active data, while PCMCIA flash cards (1–4 MB) provided removable storage. An RS-422 serial port and infrared transceiver enabled file transfer, printing, and synchronisation with Mac or Windows hosts through the Newton Connection Kit. Optional peripherals included the Newton Print Pack, a cable embedding printer drivers for ink-jet, laser, dot-matrix or thermal output. Power came from four AAA cells delivering up to 10 h of use. Despite steady software refinements, the original unit’s size, weight and unpredictable recognition accuracy limited adoption, yet it established the blueprint for later palm-size organisers.",

    "description": "Released in June 1981 by Osborne Computer Corporation, the Osborne 1 is widely regarded as the first true portable, full-featured personal computer. Encased in a vacuum-formed plastic shell with a leather carrying handle, the 24.5-pound \"luggable\" integrates a Z80 processor, 64 KB RAM, dual 5¼-inch floppy drives, and a 5-inch monochrome CRT displaying 52×24 characters. Everything—keyboard, storage, display, and power supply—fits into one self-contained unit that can be closed, carried, and set up at another location within minutes. The system runs the popular CP/M operating system and was sold with about $1,500 worth of application and programming software, making it ready to use out of the box. Designed by Lee Felsenstein, the machine was introduced at the West Coast Computer Faire in March 1981 and priced at US $1,795. Despite its small screen and hefty weight, the Osborne 1 became an immediate sales success, propelling the company to $73 million revenue and 3,000 employees within a year. Optional upgrades later added double-density disk support and external monitor capability, but premature announcements of successors and market shifts toward IBM-compatible machines contributed to the company’s rapid decline and 1983 bankruptcy.",

Running MS-DOS 2.11 from diskette, it offered about five hours of portable operation on an optional camcorder NiCd battery and could connect via external modem. Function keys provided instant calculator, terminal, and calendar utilities.

Base models offered 4 KB of RAM, quickly upgraded to 8 KB, with BASIC supplied in ROM for instant program development. The distinctive chiclet keyboard—small rubber keys arranged in a grid—was inexpensive but widely criticised as awkward for touch typing. An IEEE-488 General Purpose Interface Bus allowed daisy-chaining of up to 15 peripherals, including Commodore’s later dual floppy units. The PET’s cost-effective design, rugged steel case and integrated storage made it popular in classrooms, while its expandability appealed to hobbyists.

    "description": "The Pied Piper Communicator 1 (PPC 001) debuted at COMDEX in fall 1982 and shipped in mid-1983 as a low-cost, CP/M-based \"portable\" system. Housed in a carry-case with a handle, it weighed 12.5 lbs and integrated a single 784K floppy drive—an unusually high capacity for the era—though its 30K buffer made disk copying laborious without the optional second drive. A Z80A processor, 64K RAM, and 80×24 text output over composite or RF fed either a monitor or home TV. The machine’s non-standard floppy format was mitigated by bundled utilities able to read certain foreign disks. Every unit shipped with Perfect Software’s office suite (writer, calc, filer, speller), a package valued at $1,700 and shared with Kaypro systems. Despite aggressive pricing and a generous software bundle, the Communicator 1 failed to carve out a niche amid a crowded CP/M market already giving way to MS-DOS PCs.",

Built around PolyMorphic’s custom single-board CPU with an Intel 8080A, 512 B RAM (expandable to 16 KB), 1 KB boot ROM and dual serial ports, the machine integrates video and cassette interfaces on the CPU card instead of using scarce S-100 slots. Five bundled systems ranged from a $595 kit with 512 B RAM and 32×16 video to a $1,750 fully-assembled unit with 8 KB RAM, BASIC and peripherals. A side-mounted edge connector lets users chain up to four chassis for more expansion. Programs are saved and loaded from standard audio cassettes; there is no floppy controller. Operation is keyboard-driven: pressing Ctrl-Z invokes a software front panel for memory and register inspection, eliminating the toggle-switch panel common on contemporaries. Optional upgrades included larger RAM cards, 64-character video, analog I/O and assembled versions of every kit.",

It ships with 2 KB of internal RAM and a 16-character single-line LCD. Program and data storage rely on removable, thumb-sized modules called datapaks—EPROM cartridges available in 8 KB or 16 KB capacities that retain data for years without power. A separate rampak offers battery-backed RAM expansion for temporary workspace. The built-in applications are accessed through a concise menu: ENTER for text editing, SAVE/LOAD for datapak operations, CALC for arithmetic, FIND for record retrieval, and OFF for shutdown. Optional application paks (Finance, Maths, Science) add functionality and introduce POPL, Psion’s easy-to-learn embedded programming language, letting users write, save and run their own programs directly on the device. The serial port enables PC connectivity, while the modular storage concept influenced later systems such as the Cambridge Z88.",

Base units boot into CP/M, MS-DOS, or a VT102-compatible terminal mode for connection to DEC minicomputers. Graphics and color are optional via the NEC 7220-based Color Graphics Board, offering 400×240 with 16 colors or 800×240 with 4 colors from a 4096-color palette. Three models were sold: the floppy-only 100A, the 100B that could accept an aftermarket Winchester hard disk, and the 100+ with the hard disk factory-installed. Memory expands from 64 KB to 256 KB on the motherboard, and an ST-506 controller supports MFM drives up to 67 MB. The RX50 drive mechanism is unique: both heads move together on a single stepper motor, so only one disk is accessible at a time, and the upper and lower disks must be inserted upside-down relative to each other. Although MS-DOS was included, IBM PC compatibility is incomplete due to hardware differences, limiting software portability. Expansion slots on the motherboard accommodate memory, communications, graphics, and hard-disk options.",

The base unit shipped with 1 KB of static RAM (expandable to 4 KB) and a 2 KB monitor ROM that handles system startup, text editing and cassette I/O, leaving three additional ROM sockets free for user languages such as BASIC, FORTH or an assembler. Two edge-card expansion ports allow further I/O or memory expansion; Rockwell offered the Microflex 65 chassis supporting up to three plug-in cards (RAM, PROM, floppy, CRT, IEEE-488, etc.) and a larger Expansion Motherboard that accepts System 65 or Motorola Exorcisor cards. Power requirements are +5 V for logic and +24 V when the printer or TTY interface is used.

    "description": "The Rockwell AIM-65/40, announced in late 1981, is an upgraded descendant of the 1976 AIM-65. Centered on a 1 MHz 6502 CPU, the system integrates a 40-character vacuum-fluorescent display and an intelligent thermal printer capable of 40-column text or 280-dot-wide graphics on a single board. Base RAM is 32 KB, expandable to 48 KB, with sockets for up to 32 KB ROM/EPROM. Four edge-card connectors—Parallel, Serial, TTY, and Expansion—provide ready I/O expansion, while dual cassette interfaces offer inexpensive program and data storage. A comprehensive ROM-resident monitor handles single-keystroke commands; optional firmware adds BASIC, FORTH and a symbolic assembler. The Series 1000 CPU card supports 128 KB address space, priority interrupts, and 16-bit timers, making the AIM-65/40 suitable for both development and light industrial control. Individual display, keyboard and printer modules can be snapped together to form a complete Series 5000 system, or purchased separately for embedded use.",

QDOS, a multitasking operating system held in ROM alongside SuperBASIC, allowed concurrent applications and included networking support for up to 64 machines at 100 kbaud. Video output spanned 256×256 with eight colours or 512×256 with four colours, and the back panel offered twin network, serial, RGB/RF video and controller ports, though no parallel interface. Psion supplied the bundled productivity suite—word-processor Quill, database Archive, spreadsheet Abacus and graphics package Easel—on micro-tape. Despite advanced features, delays caused by hardware and software bugs meant some early units shipped with the OS in an external ROM cartridge. While the high-speed micro-drives were innovative, their limited capacity and sensitivity to power cycles made them less reliable than floppy disks.",

Sold at £49.95 in kit form or £69.95 ready-built in the UK, and US $99.95 stateside, it became the first machine to break the psychological $100 barrier and went on to sell about 500,000 units within a year. The entire logic fitted into four ICs: a 3.25 MHz NEC Z-80A CPU, 1 KB of static RAM, 8 KB ROM holding a floating-point BASIC interpreter, and a custom gate array that replaced dozens of TTL chips. Programs were saved to ordinary cassette tapes through a 300-baud interface, while video output was fed to any TV as a 32×22-character black-and-white image generated entirely in software by the CPU, so running in FAST mode quadrupled execution speed but made the screen flicker or go blank. Expansion came through an edge connector at the rear; the popular 16 KB RAM pack balanced precariously on this port and was notorious for wobbling and crashing the machine. The flat membrane keyboard, although spill-proof, required firm, deliberate presses and ruled out touch-typing, prompting many owners to wire in external keyboards. Despite these quirks, the ZX81 introduced a generation to programming and established Sinclair’s reputation for ultra-low-cost computing.",

Housed in a distinctive jet-black case with rubber keys that combined multiple functions, it delivered colour graphics (256×192 pixels, eight colours) and sound through a domestic TV set. The base model shipped with 16 KB of RAM, a built-in cassette interface for program storage, and Sinclair BASIC permanently stored in ROM. An edge-connector expansion bus allowed memory upgrades and peripherals such as the Sinclair thermal printer. Priced at £125, the machine became one of Britain’s first truly mainstream computers, spawning a large software library and a devoted community that persists today.",

    "description": "The Processor Technology Sol-20, released in June 1976, was among the first personal computers to integrate a keyboard and video interface in a single stylish enclosure of blue metal with genuine walnut side panels. Conceived by Lee Felsenstein as an intelligent terminal, it evolved into a full S-100 bus computer built around an Intel 8080 CPU running at 2 MHz. Standard RAM was 1 KB, expandable to 64 KB, and the monochrome display showed 64 columns by 16 rows of text. The motherboard—the earlier Sol-PC—was augmented with a case, power supply, and a full-sized keyboard to form the Sol-20, while the scarcely-shipped Sol-10 lacked the vertical backplane and used a simpler keyboard. Expansion cards plug horizontally into five S-100 slots within a height dictated by the wooden panels, making card removal cramped. Mass storage began with a built-in cassette interface; Processor Technology later offered the Helios II dual 8-inch floppy subsystem, whose single motor and head assembly served both drives and could copy disks autonomously, though reliability suffered from its mechanical complexity. Approximately 10,000 units were sold, split evenly between kits and factory-assembled machines, fostering a community of hobbyists and small-business users.",

A built-in disk-controller card manages single-sided single-density storage (89.6 KB per disk) or, via a later Z80-based controller, double-sided double-density (358.4 KB). Standard software includes the machine-language \"Exec\" DOS, 8080 macro assembler, Disk BASIC interpreter, and WordMaster text editor. Optional plug-in minicards add cassette and serial-printer interfaces without using backplane slots. A ROM-based front-panel monitor provides low-level system access, and the unit auto-boots from the leftmost drive. Although CP/M was initially unsupported, a 1980 upgrade enabled compatibility.

    "description": "The TFC 3450 was a business-oriented desktop computer produced by TRW-Fujitsu Co. of California. Built around the Panafacom MN1610—the first Japanese 16-bit microprocessor—it shipped with 128 KB of RAM, twin proprietary diskette drives, and a rugged monochrome green monitor. A standout feature was its operating system’s fixed-partition multitasking: a foreground and background partition, each supporting multiple threads under a hybrid scheduling model, switchable via a dedicated keyboard key. Application development used a compiled BASIC toolchain that produced object code linkable with assembler modules, exposing low-level system calls and revealing Japanese bit-numbering conventions. Connectivity included both asynchronous and synchronous serial ports—unusual for desktops then—targeting point-of-sale and ATM markets. The 25×80 screen reserved its bottom row for system status and function-key labels, while a non-standard parallel port drove an included dot-matrix printer whose cursive capital-O font drew teacher complaints. Overall, the system offered an unusually sophisticated programming environment for early-1980s desktop hardware.",

    "description": "The TI-99/4, launched by Texas Instruments in November 1979, was the company’s first home computer. Sold only as a $1,150 bundle with a 13-inch modified Zenith color monitor, the sleek console featured polished metal trim and a front cartridge slot. Its 16-bit TMS9900 CPU ran at 3 MHz, but only 16 KB of RAM and 26 KB of ROM were installed. TI BASIC was built into ROM and presented on startup alongside an equation calculator; programs could also be loaded from cartridges or optional cassette. BASIC execution was notoriously slow because code was interpreted twice—first by BASIC, then by TI’s proprietary Graphics Programming Language (GPL). The keyboard used low-profile chiclet keys reminiscent of calculators, reflecting TI’s calculator heritage and making touch-typing difficult. Expansion came via \"sidecar\" modules that daisy-chained from the right-hand bus; up to six could be attached, with the Speech Synthesizer required first and 32 KB Memory Expansion second. Available sidecars included RS-232, disk controller, dual 5¼-inch floppy drives, thermal printer, and an unusual Video Controller that could overlay computer output on a VCR signal and record data to videotape. Most commercial software shipped as ROM cartridges that plugged into the front port; over 80 unique titles existed. Although innovative for its time, the TI-99/4’s high price, limited RAM, awkward keyboard, and slow BASIC hampered adoption; it was superseded in June 1981 by the improved TI-99/4A.",

Base memory is 16 KB RAM plus 26 KB ROM containing TI BASIC, while RF video provides 32×24 text or 192×256 16-colour graphics. Software is loaded through a front ROM cartridge slot that became a hallmark of the system, supported by optional cassette storage at 300 baud. Expansion is via the right-side expansion bus; daisy-chaining peripherals was common until the hefty Peripheral Expansion Box (PEB) offered room for up to eight cards including 32 KB RAM, RS-232 and floppy controllers. The Speech Synthesizer and later MBX add-on brought speech synthesis and limited voice recognition to games. Aggressive price cuts—from $525 to under $100—made the 4A the best-selling U.S. home computer during 1982, but also led to losses and the line’s discontinuation in March 1984 after roughly 2.8 million units shipped.",

    "description": "Announced in October 1983 for US $1,790, the TRS-80 Model 4P was Tandy’s first transportable computer to combine a full 80 × 24 character CRT with dual built-in 5¼-inch floppy drives. A luggable, 26-pound self-contained system, it offered the same Z-80A CPU at 4 MHz and 64 KB or 128 KB RAM as the desktop Model 4 released earlier that year. The 9-inch white (later green) monochrome screen displayed 80 × 24 text, and two 180 KB single-sided drives provided storage. Standard ports included parallel, serial, and an expansion bus; an internal 300-baud modem and a high-resolution 640×240 or 512×192 graphics board were options. Unlike its desktop sibling, the 4P had no ROM-based OS, so it booted TRS-DOS, LS-DOS, or CP/M from disk. Cost-reduced gate-array variants replaced many discrete ICs and switched to green phosphor for better readability.",

Housed entirely inside the keyboard enclosure, it combined a Zilog Z-80A processor running at 1.77 MHz with 4 KB of RAM (expandable to 16 KB) and a built-in Level I BASIC interpreter in ROM. A bundled 12-inch monochrome monitor displayed 64×16 text, while programs and data were stored on ordinary audio cassettes via the cassette I/O port. An optional $299 external Expansion Interface added up to 32 KB extra RAM, printer and serial ports, and a floppy-disk controller supporting up to four drives. Two main variants were sold: early units shipped with 4 KB RAM and Level I BASIC; later units included 16 KB and Level II BASIC plus a numeric keypad. Despite its economical design and limited internal expandability, the Model I sold 10,000 units in its first month and about 200,000 by 1981, making it one of the most successful early microcomputers. Production ceased in early 1981 when the machine could not meet new FCC radio-frequency interference regulations.",

Four open slots accept optional hard-disk, Arcnet network, graphics, or 6 MHz 68000 boards that can run XENIX. Two serial and one parallel port support peripherals, while the matching desk and Disk Expansion Unit provide room for three additional 8-inch drives.

Sold primarily as bare boards or complete kits, a minimal 3-board system combined a CPU card, 2 KB dynamic-RAM card, and video/cassette-I/O card; four-board systems added extra RAM to 10 KB. Assembly demanded meticulous soldering—up to five hours for a single memory board—and a finished three-board unit could exceed 40 lb when later housed in the optional DG-brown steel case. Floppy-disk subsystems (5.25-inch and 8-inch) appeared in 1977, and turnkey packages bundled keyboard, monitor, and drives. Roughly 3,000 units were produced before rapid 1978 expansion led to quality problems, high returns, and 1979 bankruptcy.",

    "description": "The Timex Sinclair 1000, launched in July 1982, is the North American re-brand of Sinclair’s ZX-81 microcomputer. At introduction it cost only US $99.95, making it the most affordable home computer on the market and helping Timex sell roughly 600,000 units. Housed in a single small circuit board with just four ICs, the machine offered 2 KB of RAM (expandable to 64 KB via an external module), a Zilog Z80A processor running at 3.25 MHz, and a 22 × 32 text display that used a domestic television as monitor. Programs and data were stored on an ordinary cassette recorder through the built-in audio interface. An edge connector on the rear accepted add-ons such as the popular 16 KB RAM pack, a dedicated thermal printer, and other Timex/Sinclair peripherals. The entire system weighed twelve ounces and shipped with a BASIC interpreter in ROM, allowing users to write and save software immediately. Despite its rock-bottom price and impressive initial sales, the tiny membrane keyboard, limited memory, and single-task architecture quickly revealed the machine’s constraints, yet it played an important role in introducing countless households to personal computing in North America.",

    "description": "Released in July 1983 at US $79.95, the Timex Sinclair 1500 is a minimalist home computer that evolved from Sinclair’s ZX-81 lineage. Housed in a slim white case, it connects to any NTSC television via RF, outputting 22 × 32-character black-and-white text on channel 2 or 3. The machine centers on a Zilog Z80A processor running at 3.25 MHz and ships with 16 KB of RAM, expandable to 32 KB through an external 16 KB RAM module that requires POKE commands for recognition. Programs and data are saved to and loaded from ordinary cassette recorders through a 5-pin DIN connector, with Timex offering its own TS 2020 recorder as a matched peripheral. The defining improvement over earlier Sinclair models is its rubber-membrane keyboard, whose keys provide tactile feedback while retaining the multi-function layout—each key can produce up to five symbols or keywords depending on shift combinations. The mainboard contains only five logic ICs plus eight 2 KB RAM chips, yet the system boots instantly into Sinclair BASIC, allowing users to write and run software without external storage. Despite its simplicity, the TS 1500 found use in homes and schools as an ultra-affordable introduction to computing and programming.",

    "description": "Introduced at COMDEX 1981 and shipped in spring 1982, the Victor 9000 is a 16-bit business microcomputer built around the Intel 8088 processor. Base models carry 128 KB of RAM, expandable to 896 KB, and twin 5.25-inch floppy drives storing 1.2 MB per single-sided diskette or 2.4 MB double-sided; an internal or external 10.6 MB hard-disk subsystem was optional. An 800 × 400-pixel monochrome display provides 80- or 132-column text plus graphics, while two serial and one parallel port handle peripheral connections. Four proprietary internal expansion slots allow further customization. The machine runs either CP/M-86 or MS-DOS but is not hardware-compatible with the IBM PC, limiting software portability. Marketed in Europe as the Sirius 1 by ACT, it became the continent’s best-selling 16-bit business computer despite later financial troubles that pushed Victor into bankruptcy by 1984.",

Housed in a compact case, it used the Fairchild F8 microprocessor at 1.79 MHz with 1 KB RAM and delivered 16-color 400×160 graphics to a TV. The unit shipped with two joysticks and offered four controller ports; most software came on plug-in ROM cartridges—21 titles covering games, education, and productivity. Without a cartridge the machine only provided rudimentary clock, alarm, color-bar and minimal text modes. An optional APL/S cartridge supplied the APL programming language, while two hardware expanders added RS-232 serial ports, cassette interface, and a 300-baud acoustic modem. The keyboard, limited to 36 closely spaced keys, shared letters and numbers, making typing awkward. Marketed as an affordable entry-level computer, the VideoBrain appeared on the Today Show and in Popular Science, but weak sales led to liquidation by late 1979 and the company’s closure after about eighteen months.",

Built around the well-established Ferguson Big Board design, it coupled a 2.5 MHz Zilog Z80-A CPU with 64 KB of RAM and ran Digital Research's CP/M 2.2, then the de-facto standard for business software. All electronics were integrated into a sturdy 12-inch monochrome monitor that displayed 80×24 characters, while the keyboard and one or two external Shugart floppy drives (5¼-inch single-sided 81 KB or optional 8-inch 241 KB) sat on the desk. The system offered no internal expansion slots, limited users to a single serial printer port and an RS-232 communications port, and shipped with only single-sided, single-density drives, resulting in modest capacity by contemporary standards. A simple boot menu let users load software from floppy, enter a transparent typewriter-to-printer mode, or invoke basic memory utilities. Although compact and rugged, the 820's conservative specifications and high price drew criticism for being slow, unexpandable and unexceptional in a market that soon shifted toward faster, cheaper, more versatile IBM-compatible machines.",

A 20-key hex keypad and a 6-digit LED display provide the primary user interface, while an on-board cassette interface using Kansas-City-Standard modulation allows programs to be saved and loaded from any standard audio recorder. Two 8-bit parallel ports support external peripherals, and generous wire-wrap area plus optional S-100 edge connectors (45 signals) invite hardware expansion. An integral EPROM programmer generates the 25 V needed to program 2716 or 2758 devices, enabling permanent firmware storage.

    "description": "Launched in May 1985 at COMDEX and shipping late that year, the Zenith Z-171 is a briefcase-sized portable PC running MS-DOS 2.11. Built around the 80C88 processor at 4.77 MHz, it offers 256–640 KB RAM, dual 5.25-inch floppy drives, serial/parallel ports and an optional internal 300/1200-baud modem. Its 10-inch backlit LCD shows the full 80×25 text or 640×200 graphics, a major advance over earlier 16-line portables. Four built-in icon keys invoke a clock/calendar, phone-dialer terminal, disk boot and pop-up calculator without loading DOS. Derived from George Morrow’s Pivot design and licensed to meet an IRS requirement, the machine won Zenith a $27 million contract for about 15,000 units, making it one of the first large-scale government laptop deployments. Despite its 14.4-lb weight, the Z-171 provided true desktop compatibility while running virtually all IBM PC software of the era.",
