The IBM Personal Computer, model 5150, revolutionized the computing industry when it launched in the early 1980s. This ground breaking machine featured an Intel 8088 processor running at 4.77 MHz, starting with 16KB of RAM that could be expanded through additional memory chips and expansion cards. The system came with a distinctive beige chassis and IBM's commitment to an open architecture, which allowed third-party manufacturers to create compatible hardware and software.

The 5150 featured five expansion slots, enabling users to add graphics cards, memory expansions, and various peripheral controllers. Its CGA graphics capability and optional floppy disk drives made it suitable for both business applications and personal use. The computer's modular design philosophy encouraged customization and upgrades, making it accessible to businesses and enthusiasts alike.

Meanwhile, the Apple II, which had been released in 1977, continued to dominate the education and home markets with its color graphics and extensive software library. Apple's machine benefited from an earlier entry into the personal computer space and had established strong brand loyalty, particularly among schools and creative professionals who valued its superior graphics capabilities and user-friendly design.
